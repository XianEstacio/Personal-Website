      <p>
        HI, my name's Xian <br />
        <br />
        This is a not so very formal website, just wanted to you know, make it
        for fun <br />
        and kinda just introduce me to you lol. But firstly, just wanted to tell
        you that dis website project thing aint complete yet lol. <br />
        It aint pretty yet but hey, atleast I got something to start with lol.
        This is, as of 9/8/24 gonna be the first day of me launching this.
        <br />
        Expect in the coming weeks or months if I ever have free time to add
        more to this... Well I hope I can add more to this lol and not just
        abandon it.
        <br />
        Enough of that, time to actually give you some info of who I am. I'm a
        guy that likes to do a little coding, learning japanese, writing in
        cursive, and some more <br />
        but I'm too sleepy all the time to actually do stuff sometimes. Im
        interested with dreams and how or why things are what they are. <br />
        My goals are to some day help people and be rich :>. I'll try not to die
        from embarrasment and actually do things even though I'll have mistakes
        lol. <br />
        That's all, thenk you :>
